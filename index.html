    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
       Hi! I am a freelance game designer, I design assets, props, environments and levels for games using unreal engine. I also make cinematics for game trailers and cut-scenes.

        I came across Altschool on X(formally known as Twitter), With their juicy ads and I became more convinced to join Altschool since I listened to HackSultan's space
        and he spoke so detailed about the courses offered in Altschool especially Cloud Engineering which I had an eye since last year. Then I decided to take the entrance exam and I became an Altschool Cloud Engineering student 
    </p>
    <p>
        So far, I have enjoyed studying at Altschool despite some little setbacks which I believe to be some unexpected circumstances but they were handled, I commend the founders effort, The community managers,
        The staffs and most importantly the tutors especially "Mr Setemi".
